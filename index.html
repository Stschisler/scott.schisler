						<h1>Scott Schisler's 'Portfolio</h1>
						<p>First I would like to think anyone taking the time to look at my portfolio. I'm grateful that you would take your time to look at my projects. Whether you would like to see what a beginner data analysis project might look like or would like to see if my skill set would fit well for a role any feedback or suggestions are welcome. I might not be able to respond to all emails but I do appreciate your time and input.</p>
						<p>I've receently linked my favorite professional experiences to analysis and using data to help problem solve. After linking my postive experiences and some interspection, I decided it was time to put those positive work experiences and the skills I had discovered into a more prominent spot going forward in my career.<p>
						<p>I have been working on a Google Data Analytics certificate. As part of the course work we were asked to complete a project with data; below is my first project as a R-markdown. All of my analysis was performed in R, including data cleaning and visualizations. I will be working on a second project which I plan to complete in SQL, excel or google sheets, and Tableau. Once that project is complete I will update this site with the second Project.<p>
